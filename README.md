# UI Design Resources
* __coolors.co__: color scheme generator. Get random color hexes and pin the ones you like to create your own color scheme! Or browse thousands of user-generated color schemes, filtering by colors, popularity or curated schemes
* __uiGradients__: Gradient generator. Similar to coolors, preview and create your own gradients, or browse thousands of user-generated gradients.
* __fontAwesome__: library with thousands of incredibly easy to use icons for your websites. Has a paid plan but the free library is more than enough for general use.
* __iconmonstr__: bigger library than fontAwesome, just as easy to use especially if you download the font package.
* __fontello__: similar to fontAwesome and iconmonstr, but you can create a custom font and only download the icons you will actually use
* __icons8__: another icons library. It has less icons than fontAwesome, but they're highly customizable
